The aim of Corpus Variation History project is to provide services allowing to study the variation of the content of a text corpus over time.

A corpus is modified over time in different ways by: adding text, removing text, modifying existing text content.

Corpus analyzers allow to compute metrics representing a corpus at a certain point in time.
